    <h3>How She Fuels</h3>
    <p>Alex is a humaniod that requires immense amounts of food every few hours.
    You should know that it is dangerous to let her go too long without food, or her
    mannerisms become rather aggressive and hostile. Best to put prepared food in front of her
    as she is not a fan of food preparation.</p>

    <h3>How She Functions</h3>
    <p>Alex is a generally friendly humaniod when she is able to sleep for at least 8 hours, drink 
    tea in bed, and snuggle her animals. If you upset her, she is more apt to cry than fight. Avoid getting
    her wet under most circumstances, and do not awake her abruptly. When in doubt, wrapping her in a 
    warm hug should solve many of her malfunctions.</p>
